              been looking to make a <br />
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
              experience here. I signed up <br />
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
              shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br />
              weeks was the best and most grueling-time of my life. Since
              completing the course, I've <br />
              successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
              VR startup.

              Before joining the boo.camp, I've <br />never written a line of
              code. I needed <br />some structure from professionals <br />who
              can help me learn programming <br />step by step. I was encouraged
              to <br />enroll by a former student of theirs <br />who can only
              say wonderful things <br />about the program. The entire
              <br />curriculum and staff did not <br />disappoint. They were
              very hands-on <br />and I never had to wait long for
              <br />assistance. The agile team project, in <br />particular, was
              outstanding. It took <br />my learning to the next level in a way
              <br />that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />fact, I've often
              referred to it during <br />interviews as an example of my
              <br />developent experience. It certainly <br />helped me land a
              job as a full-stack <br />developer after receiving multiple
              <br />offers.100% recommend!
